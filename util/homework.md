# Mandatory 

## Create an account on Github

Go to [Github](https://github.com/)
(<https://github.com/>)
and 'Sign up' for an account


# Recommended

Work through the interactive tutorial at <https://try.github.io/>.  It's easy,
fun, and will get you familiar with some concepts we will use in the bootcamp
on Thursday afternoon. Make sure you read as you go, rather than just entering
the commands.

**NOTE:** In the second step of the tutorial, you can ignore the advice to
'create a free Code School account.' You can complete the tutorial without
creating an account.


# Optional

If you wish to install 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
on your own computer, you can do so by navigating to
<https://git-scm.com/downloads> and downloading and installing the appropriate
version for your computer.

**NOTE:** This is not mandatory for the exercise on Thursday, because the
entire exercise can be performed on the Alabama Super Computer.
