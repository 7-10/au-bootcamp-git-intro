# Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to introduce the participants of the [Auburn
University Bioinformatics
Bootcamp](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/bioinformatics/) to using
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) to version control their science!

# Exercise

At this point, you should have

1.  an account on [Github](https://github.com/)
2.  been introduced to th very basics of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Work in a group with about 2 other people. 
All of you should login to your [Github](https://github.com/).
**One** of you should fork [this
repository](https://github.com/joaks1/au-bootcamp-git-intro), by clicking the
'Fork' button on the upper right of this page.
After a few seconds, you should be looking your copy of the repo in your
account.

Next, the person that forked the repo needs to add their team members as
collabortors:

1.  Click the 'Settings' tab near the top of the page.
2.  Click 'Collaborators' in the settings menu along the left.
3.  You should be able to find your team members accounts by searching for
    their Github **username**.

Each team member that is added will receive an invitation via e-mail to
collaborate on the repository. Accept the invitation and follow the link to the
forked repo on your team member's Github account.
